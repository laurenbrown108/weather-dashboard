# weather-dashboard

With this dashboard, the user can search a US city name, and the current weather and five day forecast will populate. Important information for the current day like temp, humidity, and windspeed are displayed. For the five-day forecast, the user can see the dates of the upcoming five days, as well as temp and humidity in order to plan for a potential trip. Weather icons are displayed for all days to give the user a quicker idea of the kind of weather they can expect. Recently searched cities will display in a sidebar, if the user needs to refer to a previously viewed city.

This application was mainly implemented with HTML, Javascript, and JQuery. CSS & Bootstrap were utilized for page styling, Moment.js was used to render dates, and all weather conditions were pulled from OpenWeather's API.
